# sgu10adapters
3d part models to adapt SGU10 lamp fixtures to work with normal GU10 lamps instead of the overpriced Aurora AU-GUF4011/40 ones.

There are generally two parts, the SGU10 to GU10 adapter part and the 50mm to 63mm face ring adapter.

An instructional video [<img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2aEBEJwVzt0/maxresdefault.jpg" width="50%">](https://youtu.be/2aEBEJwVzt0)

For the SGU10 to GU10 adapter, I recommend using the invertedsepco.stl design. All the rings are more or less the same.. the ringnarrow50.stl is the latest and slightly tighter but they all work fine.

A word of warning - do not print the electrical adapter part using carbon fiber as it is electrically conductive! Use non-conductive plastic filaments only.




# Assembly instructions:

  1) Cut GU10 socket wires to 4.5cm and skin off 4mm of insulation.
  2) Insert the bare ends of the wires into the hole in the side of the hexagonal supports inside the adapter.
  3) Insert the 10mm hex standoff into the hex holes in the bottom and push it in until it crimps the wires.
  4) Screw the 5mm M3 machine screw through the hole in the top of the hex support into the hex standoff inside.
  5) Screw the GU10 socket into the two round support pillars using the 12mm M3 plastic cutting screws.
  6) Screw the GU10 pins into the bottom of the hex standoff. (If you were unable to source proper GU10 pins, 12mm M3 socket cap allen bolts seem to work, screw them in about 5mm until they bottom out against the other 5mm M3 screw from step 4).

Add to that the cost of the 3d printing.. if you can get access to a 3d printer and just pay for the filament that'd be best.

If you can't get access to a 3d printer, the cheapest place I've found to make these is 3dlondon.org;

https://3dlondon.org/product/3d-printing-2/

invertedsepco.stl - £1.00 per unit in white PLA or £1.96 in PETG
ringnarrow50.stl - £1.00 per unit in white PLA or £1.43 in PETG

PETG should be somewhat higher quality.


Ordering from makeitquick.com;

invertedsepco.stl in white PC-ABS 80% fill £7.19 per unit
ringnarrow50.stl in white PC-ABS 20% fill  £3.16 per unit

Total cost of adapter: £11.88 per unit

If using the cheaper ENGINEERING PLASTIC for invertedsepco;

invertedsepco.stl in black EP 50% fill £4.77 per unit

Total cost then: £9.46 per unit

# Sourcing the parts

  * Two GU10 pins -- or maybe substitute another M3 machine screw

    5. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/221306240232 (an alternative to actual GU10 pins is to use a 12mm M3 socket cap allen bolt.. it's not the right thing, but it does fit in the socket and they're cheap and easy to get anywhere.

  * A GU10 socket
